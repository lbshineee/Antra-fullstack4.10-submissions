*** Starting demo

MVC stands for
	Model -> Data that you want to use in your page
	View -> HTML CSS JavaScript + Razor Syntax (HTML with some C#)
	Controller -> first part of the URL "jobs" 
		Action methods -> second part of the URL "index"

Routes: the URLs

URL http://example.com/jobs/index
URL http://example.com/jobs/details/JobCode

	when going to the URL, expecting 
	VIEW -> list of jobs that you can apply
	Model -> List<Job>
	(creating models based on what the requirement needs)
public class Job
{
	JobCode
	Title
	Description
	Salary
	DatePosted
	StartDate
}

Entity Framework

http://example.com/submissions/index	-> List of submissions

http://example.com/profile/details/3
