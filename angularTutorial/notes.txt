Creting a new angular project   ->  ng new <project_name>

Similarities between C# and Angular

Controller  ->  components
Views       ->  Templates
Attributes  ->  Decorators
Services    ->  Services
DI          ->  DI
Routing     ->  Routing
Filters     ->  Guards
Middleware  ->  Interceptors
C#          ->  TypeScript (Same Inventor)

Public: for all the stuff we don't mind other ppl seeing it
Shared: The different components and models an application will share. Example: data models.
Core: Header and Footer, Services, Routes, Guards.

Decorator -> used to provide metadata to a class, method, accessor, property, or parameter. 
    And we apply it using the @expression. For example: @component, @injectable.

@NgModule is a decorator that defines the class as an angular module and adds the required metadata to it.

@injectable has two purposes:
    One is it instructs angular that this class needs a dependency
    Two is using the providedIn we inform the dependency injection system how to provide the service.


Interview Question: Is lazy always used by default. No, for small applciatons that only has some components, no need to use it.
